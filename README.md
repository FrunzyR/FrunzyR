### Welcome! 👋

🐈 Data Science Masters student and Engineering Physics graduate with a Programming background. 🐈

In my data science work, I combine statistical analysis, programming, and machine learning techniques to extract insights and build data-driven solutions. 
I primarily use Python for data processing, modeling, and automation, leveraging libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and predictive modeling. For visualization and exploratory analysis, I work with matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in data. 
I also apply statistical methods (hypothesis testing, regression analysis, feature selection) and machine learning algorithms (classification, clustering, regression) to support decision making and performance optimization. 

My workflow often includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and interpretation of results, following best practices in reproducible research and version control using Git and GitHub.
